Absolutely! Let's break your `main.go` file down **step by step**, like you're completely new to Golang and web development:
First run the following command:
```
go mod init <project-name>
```


---

### 📁 File: `main.go`

This is the **main entry point** for your application — it's the file that runs first when your program starts.

---

### 🔗 Step 1: Import Packages

```go
import (
	"os"
	"golang-restaurant-management/database"
	middleware "golang-restaurant-management/middleware"
	routes "golang-restaurant-management/routes"
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"
)
```

**What’s happening here?**

* `os` → Helps us get environment variables (like port number).
* `database` → Your own Go file/folder where you connect to MongoDB.
* `middleware` → Another Go file/folder that has things like authentication logic.
* `routes` → Your Go file/folder where all the API endpoints are organized.
* `gin` → A popular framework in Go for building web servers and APIs.
* `mongo` → The MongoDB driver for Go (lets your app talk to MongoDB).

---

### 🔧 Step 2: Declare a Global Collection

```go
var foodCollection *mongo.Collection = database.OpenCollection(database.Client, "food")
```

This line is saying:

> “Hey, open the `food` collection (kind of like a table) from our MongoDB database, and keep it ready so we can use it anywhere.”

---

### 🚀 Step 3: `main()` Function

This is where your app actually starts.

```go
func main() {
```

---

### 🟢 Step 4: Get the Port to Run the Server On

```go
	port := os.Getenv("PORT")

	if port == "" {
		port = "8000"
	}
```

This code means:

> “Check if the system (like Heroku or your local machine) gave us a port number to run on. If not, default to port `8000`.”

---

### 🛠 Step 5: Set Up the Web Server

```go
	router := gin.New()
	router.Use(gin.Logger())
```

You're creating a new web server using the **Gin framework**:

* `gin.New()` → Starts a clean Gin router (like Express in Node.js).
* `gin.Logger()` → Adds logging to print every request the server gets.

---

### 🔐 Step 6: Set Up Routes

```go
	routes.UserRoutes(router)
```

You are adding the **user-related routes** first (like signup, login).

Then:

```go
	router.Use(middleware.Authentication())
```

This means:

> “From now on, only authenticated users can access the remaining routes.”

Then you load all the other routes:

```go
	routes.FoodRoutes(router)
	routes.MenuRoutes(router)
	routes.TableRoutes(router)
	routes.OrderRoutes(router)
	routes.OrderItemRoutes(router)
	routes.InvoiceRoutes(router)
```

Each of these is a file where you define routes like:

* `/foods`
* `/menus`
* `/tables`
* etc.

---

### 🔚 Step 7: Start the Server

```go
	router.Run(":" + port)
```

This means:

> “Start the web server and listen for incoming requests on the given port (like `localhost:8000`).”

---

### ✅ Summary (Super Simple)

* You set up your app to **connect to MongoDB**.
* You **create an HTTP server** using the Gin framework.
* You **add all your API routes**, grouped by their functionality (users, food, orders, etc.).
* You protect routes with **authentication middleware**.
* You **start the server** and listen for requests.

---

### 🔄 All of them are *importing packages* — so why the different syntax?

```go
import (
	"golang-restaurant-management/database"                // 👈 normal import
	middleware "golang-restaurant-management/middleware"    // 👈 import with alias
	routes "golang-restaurant-management/routes"            // 👈 import with alias
)
```

---

### ✅ 1. The **first one**:

```go
"golang-restaurant-management/database"
```

This just imports the package **as-is**, using its default name, which is the name of the folder: `database`.

So in your code, you'll refer to it like this:

```go
database.OpenCollection(...)
```

---

### ✅ 2. The **other two**:

```go
middleware "golang-restaurant-management/middleware"
routes "golang-restaurant-management/routes"
```

This is the **aliasing syntax**.

You are saying:

> "I want to import this package, but refer to it as `middleware` or `routes` in my code."

In this case, the alias is **the same** as the folder name, so it doesn’t *really* change anything.

But in some cases, you may want to alias to:

* avoid name conflicts
* use a shorter name
* improve clarity

---

### 🔎 So why the difference?

Technically, **both ways are valid** and do the same thing **if the alias matches the folder name**.

#### ✅ This:

```go
"golang-restaurant-management/routes"
```

is the same as:

```go
routes "golang-restaurant-management/routes"
```

The alias is **optional** *if* you are happy using the default name (which is the last part of the import path — the folder name).

---

### 💡 So in your file:

This:

```go
routes.UserRoutes(router)
```

would work **whether or not** you write `routes "golang-restaurant-management/routes"` because the folder is already named `routes`.

So, the difference here is **just style** — some people always explicitly alias their imports to make things clearer or consistent.

---

### ✅ TL;DR

| Syntax                 | What it means     | When to use                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"package/path"`       | Normal import     | Use when default name (folder name) is fine                         |
| `alias "package/path"` | Import with alias | Use to shorten long names, resolve name clashes, or improve clarity |

---











```go
func UserRoutes(incomingRoutes *gin.Engine)
```

We'll explain this in two parts:

---

### ✅ Part 1: What is `incomingRoutes`?

**No — `incomingRoutes` is *not* a keyword.**

You can name it **anything you want** — it's just a variable name, like `x`, `user`, or `router`.

So this:

```go
func UserRoutes(incomingRoutes *gin.Engine)
```

could also be written like:

```go
func UserRoutes(router *gin.Engine)
```

It would work exactly the same — the name is just for **your own understanding**.

In this case, the name `incomingRoutes` just tells you:

> "This is the Gin router object passed from the outside (probably from `main.go`) where all the routes will be added."

---

### ✅ Part 2: What is `*gin.Engine`?

This is the **type** of the variable — it tells Go what kind of thing `incomingRoutes` is.

Let’s break it down:

* `gin.Engine` → This is Gin’s **main object** that represents your whole web server and all the routes.
* `*gin.Engine` → The asterisk (`*`) means it's a **pointer** to a `gin.Engine` object.

---

### 🔧 But what's a `*pointer` in simple terms?

In Go, `*gin.Engine` means:

> “I’m not working with a copy of the web server — I’m working with the actual one, so any routes I add here will affect the real server.”

So when you write:

```go
func UserRoutes(incomingRoutes *gin.Engine)
```

You're saying:

> "This function will receive the real Gin router (not a copy), and I’ll use it to add new routes like `/users`, `/login`, etc."

---

### 🔁 How does this work in `main.go`?

You probably call it like this:

```go
router := gin.New()
routes.UserRoutes(router)
```

Here:

* `router` is the actual Gin router you created.
* You pass it to `UserRoutes(...)` so that the function can **add routes** onto it.

---

### 🧠 Simple Analogy

Imagine:

* `gin.Engine` = a blank whiteboard.
* `router := gin.New()` = you buy a new whiteboard.
* `UserRoutes(router)` = you give the whiteboard to someone who writes "Signup", "Login", etc. on it.
* `*gin.Engine` = means you gave them the **real whiteboard**, not a photo — so the changes stay.

---

### ✅ TL;DR

| Term             | Meaning                                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `incomingRoutes` | Just a variable name for the router (you can rename it)                          |
| `*gin.Engine`    | Type: it's a pointer to the real Gin web server object                           |
| Why use `*`?     | So we modify the real router, not a copy                                         |
| What does it do? | Lets us define new routes (like `/users`) and attach them to the main web server |

---







---

> In **Go**, if a function, variable, type, or constant starts with a **capital letter**, it is **exported** (i.e., publicly accessible from other packages).
> If it starts with a **lowercase letter**, it is **private** to that package.

---

### 🧠 So in This case:

```go
func UserRoutes(...) { ... }
```

* Starts with a capital **`U`** → ✅ So this function is **exported**.
* This means it can be accessed like this from another file:

```go
routes.UserRoutes(router)
```

Even though you never wrote something like `export` (like in JavaScript), the **capital letter is the signal to the compiler** that it's public.

---

### 🔒 What if you wrote it like this?

```go
func userRoutes(...) { ... }
```

Now:

* Starts with lowercase `u` → ❌ Not exported
* If you try to call it from another package (like `routes.userRoutes(...)`), you’ll get a compile error:

```
undefined: routes.userRoutes
```

Because it’s private inside the `routes` package.

---

### 📘 Applies to Everything in Go

This capital-letter rule applies to:

* **Functions**: `Println` is exported from the `fmt` package
* **Structs**: `type User struct {}` vs `type user struct {}`
* **Variables/constants**: `const Pi = 3.14` vs `const pi = 3.14`

---

### ✅ Summary (Very Beginner Friendly)

| Starts With    | Visibility               | Example                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Capital letter | **Public** / Exported    | `UserRoutes()` is usable in `main.go`              |
| Small letter   | **Private** / Unexported | `userRoutes()` only usable inside `routes` package |

You don’t need to write `public` or `private` in Go — just capitalize or not.

### 📁 File: `database/connection.go`

(Naming may vary, but this is your DB setup file.)

---

## 🧱 Imports

```go
import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"time"

	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"
	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo/options"
)
```

### What do these mean?

| Import              | What it's for                                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `context`           | Used to manage timeouts and cancellations (e.g., "stop trying after 10s")    |
| `fmt`               | Print to terminal (`fmt.Print`, `fmt.Println`)                               |
| `log`               | Logging errors (e.g., if MongoDB fails to connect)                           |
| `time`              | Work with timeouts or delays                                                 |
| `mongo` & `options` | These are from the official MongoDB Go Driver — they let you talk to MongoDB |

---

## 🔧 Function: `DBinstance()`

```go
func DBinstance() *mongo.Client {
```

* `func` — defines a function
* `DBinstance()` — the name of the function
* `*mongo.Client` — it returns a pointer to a MongoDB client (i.e., a connection to the database)

> ✅ This function sets up the connection to your MongoDB server.

---

### 🧭 Define your MongoDB URI (connection string)

```go
	MongoDb := "mongodb://localhost:27017"
	fmt.Print(MongoDb)
```

* This says: "Connect to MongoDB running locally on port 27017"
* `fmt.Print(...)` — prints that string to your terminal

---

### 🚪 Create a new MongoDB client

```go
	client, err := mongo.NewClient(options.Client().ApplyURI(MongoDb))
```

* `mongo.NewClient(...)` — creates a new MongoDB client
* `options.Client().ApplyURI(...)` — tells it where your MongoDB server is
* `err` — if something goes wrong, this will catch the error

---

### ⚠️ Check for error

```go
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
```

* `if err != nil` — if there **is** an error...
* `log.Fatal(err)` — print it and **stop the program**

---

### 🕐 Set timeout for connection

```go
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
	defer cancel()
```

* `context.WithTimeout(...)` — tells MongoDB: **"You have 10 seconds to connect. After that, give up."**
* `defer cancel()` — schedules `cancel()` to run when the function ends (clean up resources)

---

### 🔌 Connect to MongoDB

```go
	err = client.Connect(ctx)
```

This line tells your app:

> “Now, actually **try to connect** to MongoDB using the context with the timeout.”

---

### ❗Handle any connection error

```go
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
```

If it fails to connect, log the error and stop.

---

### ✅ Confirm the connection worked

```go
	fmt.Println("connected to mongodb")
```

Just prints a success message if everything worked.

---

### 🔙 Return the MongoDB client

```go
	return client
}
```

This gives back the connected client object so you can use it in other parts of your app.

---

## 🌍 Global Variable: `Client`

```go
var Client *mongo.Client = DBinstance()
```

* This runs `DBinstance()` when your app starts
* Stores the MongoDB connection in a global variable `Client`
* Now **any file** can import this package and use `database.Client`

---

## 📂 Function: `OpenCollection`

```go
func OpenCollection(client *mongo.Client, collectionName string) *mongo.Collection {
```

* `OpenCollection(...)` is a helper function
* It accepts:

  * a MongoDB client
  * a collection name (like "users", "orders", etc.)
* It returns a pointer to that **MongoDB collection**

---

### 🏗 Get the actual collection

```go
	var collection *mongo.Collection = client.Database("restaurant").Collection(collectionName)
```

* `client.Database("restaurant")` → Accesses the database named `"restaurant"`
* `.Collection(collectionName)` → Accesses a collection/table inside it

---

### 🔙 Return the collection

```go
	return collection
}
```

Now you can use that returned collection to do things like insert data, read data, etc.

---

Great! Let’s go **line-by-line** and break this down for you **like you're new to Go, Gin, and MongoDB**. You're looking at a typical **GET handler** in a Go REST API built using the Gin web framework.

---

### 🧠 FUNCTION SIGNATURE: `func GetUser() gin.HandlerFunc`

#### 🔹 `gin.HandlerFunc`

* This is a **type** from the `Gin` web framework.

* It is **just a function that takes `*gin.Context` as an argument**:

  ```go
  type HandlerFunc func(*Context)
  ```

* So when you write:

  ```go
  func GetUser() gin.HandlerFunc
  ```

  You're returning a handler function that can process a web request.

---

### 🔁 RETURNING AN INLINE HANDLER FUNCTION

```go
return func(c *gin.Context) {
```

* This **returns** a handler function, like saying:

  > “Hey Gin, when someone calls `/users/:user_id`, run this function.”

* `c *gin.Context` contains all the info about the HTTP request, like:

  * URL params
  * Headers
  * Request body
  * How to send a response

---

### ⏳ CONTEXT SETUP

```go
var ctx, cancel = context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 100*time.Second)
```

* **Purpose**: Set a timeout for DB queries (to avoid hanging connections).
* `context.Background()` starts a new root context.
* `WithTimeout` says: "Cancel the DB query if it takes more than 100 seconds."
* `cancel` is a cleanup function that should be **deferred** (called at the end).

---

### 🧾 PATH PARAMETER EXTRACTION

```go
userId := c.Param("user_id")
```

* Extracts the path parameter from the URL.
* If the route is `/users/:user_id` and you hit `/users/123`, then `userId = "123"`

---

### 📦 WHAT IS THIS: `var user models.User`

```go
var user models.User
```

* Declares a variable `user` of type `User` which is a **struct defined in your `models` package**.
* This will be used to store data fetched from MongoDB.

Example `User` model (you likely have something like this):

```go
type User struct {
    ID        primitive.ObjectID `bson:"_id"`
    Name      string             `bson:"name"`
    Email     string             `bson:"email"`
    // ...
}
```

---

### 📦 WHAT IS `bson`?

```go
bson.M{"user_id": userId}
```

* `bson` stands for **Binary JSON**, the format MongoDB uses to store data.
* `bson.M` is a shorthand for **map\[string]interface{}** — like a JSON object in Go.

So:

```go
bson.M{"user_id": userId}
```

means:

```json
{ "user_id": "123" }
```

This is the **MongoDB filter** to find one user.

---

### 🧲 DATABASE QUERY

```go
err := userCollection.FindOne(ctx, bson.M{"user_id": userId}).Decode(&user)
```

* `userCollection`: your MongoDB "users" collection (already set up).
* `.FindOne(...)`: Search for one document matching the filter.
* `.Decode(&user)`: Convert MongoDB document into your Go struct (`models.User`).

---

### 🧹 CLEANUP

```go
defer cancel()
```

* Ensures that the `cancel()` function (from the context) runs **after this function ends**.
* It’s like saying: "Once you're done, clean up the timeout context."

---

### 🚫 IF USER NOT FOUND OR ERROR

```go
if err != nil {
	c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, gin.H{"error": "error occurred while listing user items"})
}
```

* If there's an error (like no user found or DB failure), return a `500 Internal Server Error`.

> `gin.H` is just shorthand for `map[string]interface{}` — it creates JSON easily.

---

### ✅ SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE

```go
c.JSON(http.StatusOK, user)
```

* Sends back a `200 OK` HTTP response with the `user` struct as JSON.

---

### 🧠 SUMMARY:

You wrote a function that Gin can use when someone requests a user. It:

1. Waits max 100s to avoid stuck requests.
2. Gets the user ID from the URL.
3. Queries the MongoDB users collection.
4. If found, sends the user back as JSON.
5. If there's a problem, shows an error.





Absolutely — let’s break this down **very clearly and simply**, step by step. You're right to want to understand *every part* like `&SignedDetails`, `jwt.StandardClaims`, `NewWithClaims`, etc. So here we go:

---

### 🔐 What is this whole block doing?

It's **creating a JWT access token and a refresh token** for a user after they log in or sign up.

---

### 📦 First: What is `SignedDetails`?

In your code, this is a **custom struct** you created:

```go
type SignedDetails struct {
    Email      string
    First_name string
    Last_name  string
    Uid        string
    jwt.StandardClaims
}
```

This means:

* You are defining a new struct type named `SignedDetails`.
* It has your custom fields: `Email`, `First_name`, `Last_name`, and `Uid`.
* It also embeds `jwt.StandardClaims`, which comes from the JWT library and contains default JWT fields like `ExpiresAt` (when the token expires), `Issuer`, etc.

---

### 📍 Now what is `&SignedDetails{ ... }`?

This is how you **create a pointer to a `SignedDetails` struct** in Go.

* `SignedDetails{ ... }` — creates a value of that struct.
* `&SignedDetails{ ... }` — gives you a *pointer* to that struct. This is needed because `jwt.NewWithClaims` expects a pointer.

---

### 🕒 What is `jwt.StandardClaims{ ExpiresAt: ... }`?

This is part of the JWT package. It gives you standard claims like:

* `ExpiresAt`: When the token should expire.
* `Issuer`: Who issued the token.
* `Subject`: The subject of the token.
* etc.

Here, you’re setting just one:

```go
ExpiresAt: time.Now().Local().Add(time.Hour * 24).Unix()
```

That means:

* Take the current local time (`time.Now().Local()`),
* Add 24 hours to it,
* Convert it to a Unix timestamp (an integer) using `.Unix()`.

So the token will expire **24 hours from now**.

For the refresh token, it's 168 hours (7 days):

```go
time.Now().Local().Add(time.Hour * 168).Unix()
```

---

### 🔏 What does this line do?

```go
token, err := jwt.NewWithClaims(jwt.SigningMethodHS256, claims).SignedString([]byte(SECRET_KEY))
```

Let’s break this line into parts:

#### `jwt.NewWithClaims(...)`

This creates a new JWT token object.

* `jwt.SigningMethodHS256`: This is the algorithm used to sign the token (HMAC SHA-256).
* `claims`: The payload — your `SignedDetails` struct.

#### `.SignedString([]byte(SECRET_KEY))`

* This signs the JWT with your secret key (`SECRET_KEY`) so it can’t be tampered with.
* `SECRET_KEY` must be a byte slice (`[]byte`), hence the conversion.

This returns:

* `token`: the final **JWT token string**.
* `err`: if anything failed during signing.

---

### 🧼 What about the `refreshClaims`?

Same idea, but with only the `ExpiresAt` and no user info:

```go
refreshClaims := &SignedDetails{
    StandardClaims: jwt.StandardClaims{
        ExpiresAt: time.Now().Local().Add(time.Hour * 168).Unix(),
    },
}
```

You use this to generate a **refresh token** — which the user can send to get a new access token once the old one expires.

---

### ✅ Final return

```go
return token, refreshToken, err
```

* `token`: valid for 24 hours (access token)
* `refreshToken`: valid for 7 days (refresh token)
* `err`: error, if any occurred

---

### 🧠 Why do we use tokens in the first place?

* **Access Token**: Sent with each request to prove the user is logged in. Expires quickly (24 hrs here).
* **Refresh Token**: Used to get a new access token when the old one expires. Longer-lived (7 days here).
* **JWTs**: Self-contained — include user info + expiry inside the token. No need to query DB every time.

---

### Summary of Each Keyword:

| Keyword                      | Meaning                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `&SignedDetails{...}`        | Create a pointer to a `SignedDetails` struct |
| `jwt.StandardClaims`         | Built-in JWT fields like `ExpiresAt`         |
| `jwt.NewWithClaims(...)`     | Create a new token with claims               |
| `.SignedString([]byte(...))` | Sign the token with a secret key             |
| `SECRET_KEY`                 | Your app’s private key for signing JWTs      |

---

Would you like me to now **walk you through how this token is used in the login/signup flow**, or how it’s **validated** later when users make authenticated requests?





Awesome — this is a critical piece in your authentication system. You're now looking at how JWT **validation** works in Go using Gin and the `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt` package.

Let’s break **every single line and concept** down in your `ValidateToken` function:

---

## 🧠 Function Signature

```go
func ValidateToken(signedToken string) (claims *SignedDetails, msg string)
```

* `signedToken`: The JWT token string sent by the user (usually in headers like `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
* `returns`:

  * `claims`: pointer to your `SignedDetails` struct if token is valid.
  * `msg`: error message string, empty if token is valid.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Parse the Token

```go
token, err := jwt.ParseWithClaims(
	signedToken,
	&SignedDetails{},
	func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error) {
		return []byte(SECRET_KEY), nil
	},
)
```

### 🔍 What's happening?

* `jwt.ParseWithClaims`: Parses and **validates** the JWT.

  * `signedToken`: the raw token string sent by the user.
  * `&SignedDetails{}`: tells JWT how to decode the custom claims you expect.
  * The **3rd argument** is a callback function that returns the secret key needed to verify the token signature.

#### 🛡️ Purpose of the callback function:

```go
func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error) {
	return []byte(SECRET_KEY), nil
}
```

* This is used to return the secret key you used while signing.
* It also ensures you're using a known key and algorithm.

---

## 🔒 Step 2: Extract the Claims

```go
claims, ok := token.Claims.(*SignedDetails)
```

### Explanation:

* After parsing, the token contains a `.Claims` field, which should be your `SignedDetails` struct.
* You're trying to **assert that** the claims inside the token are of type `*SignedDetails`.

If they’re not (e.g., token was malformed or decoded incorrectly), then:

```go
if !ok {
	msg = fmt.Sprintf("the token is invalid")
	msg = err.Error()
	return
}
```

* `msg = err.Error()` gives the actual parsing error (e.g., invalid signature).
* The function returns early.

---

## ⏳ Step 3: Check Expiry

```go
if claims.ExpiresAt < time.Now().Local().Unix() {
	msg = fmt.Sprint("token is expired")
	msg = err.Error()
	return
}
```

### What is this doing?

* `claims.ExpiresAt`: You set this when signing the token (in `StandardClaims`).
* `time.Now().Local().Unix()`: Current time in Unix timestamp format.
* If `ExpiresAt` is in the past → token has **expired** → reject it.

---

## ✅ Final Return

```go
return claims, msg
```

* If everything went well:

  * `claims` contains all user info (`Email`, `Uid`, etc.)
  * `msg` is `""` (empty), meaning no error.

---

## 🧪 Example Use in Middleware

In your `AuthMiddleware` or protected route, you’d typically do:

```go
claims, errMsg := helper.ValidateToken(token)
if errMsg != "" {
	c.JSON(http.StatusUnauthorized, gin.H{"error": errMsg})
	return
}
```

So if:

* Token is invalid → reject with `401 Unauthorized`.
* Token is valid → proceed with `claims.Email`, etc.

---

## 🚨 One gotcha to watch

If `jwt.ParseWithClaims()` fails (e.g. due to malformed token), `token` could be `nil`, so technically a safer version is:

```go
if err != nil || token == nil {
	msg = "token parsing failed"
	return
}
```




Yes, let’s walk through **how this token is used in the login/signup flow** *and* then how it’s **validated during authenticated requests**.

We'll break it into **two flows**:

---

## 🔐 1. **Token Generation During Signup/Login**

This is where the user gets their **access token** and **refresh token** after logging in or signing up.

### 📦 Usually in `controllers/auth.go`:

```go
token, refreshToken, err := helper.GenerateAllTokens(
	user.Email,
	user.First_name,
	user.Last_name,
	user.User_id,
)
```

> 🔁 This calls your `GenerateAllTokens()` function, which:

* Creates a `SignedDetails` struct (custom claims).
* Signs it using `jwt.NewWithClaims()`.
* Returns a JWT string (the token) and refresh token.

### 🧠 What happens next?

The controller typically:

```go
user.Token = token
user.RefreshToken = refreshToken
```

And then either:

* Saves them in MongoDB with the user document (optional).
* Or just returns them in the response:

```go
c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
	"token": token,
	"refresh_token": refreshToken,
	"user": user,
})
```

Now the client (frontend or mobile app) stores that token — usually in `localStorage`, `cookies`, or a secure storage mechanism.

---

## 🔒 2. **Token Validation in Protected Routes**

This happens when a user sends a request to a protected API, like:

```http
GET /user/profile
Authorization: Bearer <your.jwt.token>
```

### 🛡️ In Gin, you create an **auth middleware**:

```go
func AuthMiddleware() gin.HandlerFunc {
	return func(c *gin.Context) {
		clientToken := c.Request.Header.Get("Authorization")

		if clientToken == "" {
			c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, gin.H{"error": "No Authorization header provided"})
			c.Abort()
			return
		}

		// Remove "Bearer " prefix
		tokenString := strings.Split(clientToken, " ")[1]

		claims, msg := helper.ValidateToken(tokenString)
		if msg != "" {
			c.JSON(http.StatusUnauthorized, gin.H{"error": msg})
			c.Abort()
			return
		}

		// Attach user claims to context for downstream access
		c.Set("email", claims.Email)
		c.Set("uid", claims.Uid)

		c.Next()
	}
}
```

### 📌 Now any route you want to protect, you use:

```go
router.GET("/user/profile", middleware.AuthMiddleware(), controller.GetUserProfile())
```

| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Login/Signup**          | Server generates token using user info, signs it with secret, sends it to client |
| **Frontend stores**       | JWT stored locally or in cookies                                                 |
| **Client sends requests** | Sends token in `Authorization` header                                            |
| **Server Middleware**     | Validates token using `ValidateToken()`                                          |
| **Protected Route**       | Uses claims to identify user (`c.Get("uid")`, etc.)                              |

## 🪪 JWT Token vs 🔁 Refresh Token — What’s the Difference?

| Feature              | **JWT Token (Access Token)**                | **Refresh Token**                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔐 **Purpose**       | Proves the user is logged in                | Used to get a **new JWT** after the old one expires    |
| ⏳ **Expiry Time**    | Short-lived (e.g. 15 min to 24 hours)       | Long-lived (e.g. 7–30 days)                            |
| 📦 **Contains Data** | Yes — includes user info (email, id, etc.)  | Usually not — just a secure string                     |
| 📤 **Used in...**    | Sent on **every request to protected APIs** | Only sent to `/refresh` endpoint                       |
| 📦 **Stored Where?** | Usually in `cookie` or `localStorage`       | Secure cookie or localStorage (rare, if secured)       |
| 🔁 **Used For?**     | Authenticating API calls                    | Getting a new JWT without forcing the user to re-login |

---

## 🔐 Why Do We Need *Both*?

If you only used a JWT with long expiry (like 30 days):

* 🧨 It would be risky — if the token gets stolen, attacker has access for 30 days.
* ❌ You’d have to ask the user to re-login if the short-lived token expires.

So we do this:

1. 🔓 **JWT** is short-lived → safer
2. 🔁 **Refresh Token** stays longer → lets us silently refresh the JWT

---

## 🔄 Example Flow

1. ✅ **User logs in**

   * Server sends:

     * JWT (valid 15 min – 1 day)
     * Refresh Token (valid 7–30 days)

2. 🔐 **User makes API requests** with JWT

3. ⏰ **JWT expires**

   * Client automatically sends refresh token to `/refresh`
   * Server checks if refresh token is valid
   * ✅ If valid, new JWT is sent back

4. 🚫 **If refresh token is invalid** → force user to login again

---

## 🔥 Visual Summary:

```
[ Login ] 
    ↓
[JWT] <--- 15 min expiry → used in API calls
[Refresh Token] <--- 7 days expiry → used to get new JWT

When JWT expires:
    → Send refresh token to server
    → Get new JWT back
```

---








Signup: User registers → password hashed → JWT tokens generated → stored in DB
Login: User logs in → password verified → new JWT tokens generated → updated in DB
Protected Routes: Token validated → user info extracted → request proceeds
